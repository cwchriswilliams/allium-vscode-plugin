# Allium Tools

> **Pre-release notice:** This software is currently in a pre-release state. Treat it as unstable, expect breaking changes, and validate it carefully before production use.

Allium Tools is the multi-editor platform for the Allium specification language. It provides rich editor integration, a standalone Language Server (LSP), and a suite of CLI tools for validation, formatting, and analysis.

## What is Allium?

Allium is a domain-specific language for specifying system behavior, rules, and data models. It focuses on clarity, traceability, and automated validation.

### Key Concepts

- **Blocks**: Top-level declarations like `rule`, `entity`, `enum`, `config`, `context`, `surface`, and `actor`.
- **Clauses**: Express requirements and effects using `when:`, `requires:`, and `ensures:`.
- **Traceability**: Built-in support for linking specifications to implementation and tests.

### Brief Syntax Example

```allium
module ordering

use "std/orders" as orders

entity Order {
    id: string
    status: orders.Status
}

rule PlaceOrder {
    trigger: User.Click("Place Order")
    requires: basket.is_not_empty
    ensures: Order.created(status: orders.Status.Pending)
}
```
