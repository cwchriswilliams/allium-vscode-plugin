# AGENTS.md

Guidance for human and AI agents working on this codebase.

The goals are:

* High-quality, maintainable, professional code
* Strong, meaningful tests (quality over quantity)
* Safe, predictable collaboration between humans and LLMs
* A consistent task system for multi-session work

> **Important:** The `README.md` is the initial guide to the key concepts in the app.
> Always read or skim `README.md` at the **start of every session** before interacting with tasks.

---

## 1. General workflow

When beginning any session:

1. **Review `README.md`** to re-establish context.
2. Choose an issue or task ID from the external backlog.
3. Start work using the `/workon <task-id>` workflow described in Section 4.

---

## 2. Coding principles

* **Clarity over cleverness**: prefer simple, readable solutions.
* **Minimal, focused changes**: make the smallest change that solves the problem well.
* **Consistency with existing patterns**: match naming, structure, and design already used in the repo.
* **Preserve existing behavior unless explicitly changing it**.
* **Respect architecture**: extend existing abstractions rather than invent new ones.
* **Error handling**: follow established error-handling conventions; avoid silent failures.
* **Dependencies**: avoid adding new libraries unless absolutely necessary and justified.

---

## 3. Testing principles

The application must be **well tested**. We value **meaningful, behavior-focused tests**, not raw coverage numbers.

* **Unit tests**: all non-trivial logic (utilities, domain rules, data transformations) must have high-quality unit tests.
* **React Testing Library (RTL) tests**: UI components must be tested through RTL, verifying behaviour from the user's perspective rather than implementation details.
* **Integration tests**: use integration tests where components, services, or layers interact — particularly around data flows, API boundaries, and the database abstraction layer.
* Test key paths, edge cases, and important error conditions.
* Avoid breaking real behaviour just to satisfy tests.
* Prefer realistic tests that reflect actual usage.
* Follow established testing conventions in the repository.
* When adding new features, create or update tests in a way that protects important logic.

## 4. Task system and `llm-tasks/`

Task files are maintained primarily for LLM continuity across sessions.
They capture **current understanding**, **current work**, and **useful discoveries**, not historical logs.

### 4.1 Location and naming

Task documents live in:

```
./llm-tasks/<task-id>.md
```

* `<task-id>` generally corresponds to a ticket or issue ID (e.g. `PROJ-123`, `GH-42`).
* The **issue tracker is the single source of truth for task status**.
* Task docs do **not** track done/active/abandoned state.

### 4.2 Template

`./llm-tasks/task-template.md` defines the structure for new tasks.
When invoking `/workon <task-id>`:

1. If the task file exists, load it.
2. If not, copy `task-template.md` to `./llm-tasks/<task-id>.md` and fill in any placeholders.

Task documents generally include sections such as:

* **Task Summary** – A concise restatement of what the task is about.
* **Current Understanding** – The current interpretation of the problem and its constraints.
* **What We Need to Do** – A list of the current actionable items or subtasks.
* **Important Learnings** – Discoveries, insights, or clarifications gained during development.
* **Important Files / Components** – Key parts of the codebase relevant to the task.
* **Reasoning Notes** – Explanations where needed (e.g. why earlier understanding was rewritten or discarded).

> These files are meant to be readable by LLMs and may be verbose.
> Human readability is secondary but should still be coherent.

### 4.3 How task documents evolve

Task docs represent the **current best understanding**, not a historical record.
They **can and should be rewritten** when new insights make old content obsolete.

However:

* When rewriting or replacing existing sections, the task document should include a brief note in **Reasoning Notes** explaining *why* the rewrite occurred.
* The goal is clarity, not log-keeping.
* Outdated or incorrect sections should be removed or replaced to avoid misleading future sessions.

### 4.4 `/workon <task-id>` command behavior

When `/workon <task-id>` is used:

* Load the corresponding task file.
* Keep the task file updated with:

  * Newly discovered constraints or clarifications.
  * Updates to the list of things that need to be done.
  * New learnings about the codebase.
  * Notes explaining meaningful rewrites.

During active work:

* The agent should update the **specific, relevant sections** of the task file.
* Broad rewrites are allowed **only when clearly beneficial**, and must include a brief explanation.

---

## 5. Editing rules for task files

To keep task documents stable, coherent, and useful for LLMs:

1. **Preserve the template’s section structure**

   * Do not remove or rename major sections unless explicitly instructed.

2. **Rewrite freely when needed**

   * If new information invalidates earlier content, rewrite those portions.
   * Major rewrites must include a brief explanation in **Reasoning Notes**.

3. **Focus on current truth**

   * Do not maintain historical logs or timestamps.
   * Only keep what is currently correct, useful, and relevant.

4. **Keep content concise where possible**

   * Avoid overly detailed logs, stack traces, or full code listings.
   * Summaries and short explanations are preferred.

5. **Never include secrets or sensitive data**

   * Replace any sensitive material with placeholders such as `[REDACTED]`.

6. **Assume human review**

   * All task doc changes are subject to human review before merge.

---

## 6. LLM editing rules for code and tests

When modifying code or tests:

* Make targeted, minimal changes.
* Preserve formatting and style.
* Avoid refactoring unless explicitly asked.
* Do not modify large unrelated regions of code.
* Ensure updates align with the task document’s current understanding.

### Tests

* Prioritize meaningful coverage: critical branches, behaviors, and edge cases.
* Avoid brittle tests tied to internal implementation details.
* Do not degrade real behavior to satisfy tests.
* Fix incorrect tests where appropriate.

---

## 7. Security, privacy, and sensitive data

* Never commit or write secrets, tokens, passwords, or user data.
* When in doubt, anonymize.
* Any suspected sensitive data must be replaced with `[REDACTED]`.

---

## 8. Sources of truth

* **Architecture & key concepts:** `README.md` (read at the start of each session)
* **Current understanding of an individual task:** `./llm-tasks/<task-id>.md`
* **Task status and lifecycle:** external issue tracker
* **Technical decisions made during development:** included in the task doc under *Reasoning Notes*
